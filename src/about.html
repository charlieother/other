  <h2>Long, Long Ago</h2>

  <p></p>Freedom Fever was founded in 2005 in Los Angeles, California by Charlie Bow. Originally an artist collective designed to pool resources and provide structure and support to collaboration, Freedom Fever quickly evolved to become a full-scale distributed production company. Early successes mostly took the form of indie releases from our roster of artists, sync placements in film and television, and contracted composition services for brands. </p>

<p>During the 2008 financial crisis, Freedom Fever reduced itâ€™s footprint  and began offering services to fellow musicians, bands, voiceover artists, actors, and other creatives. We provided audio recording, engineering, mixing, and mastering, web design, photography, marketing consultation, video editing, and home studio design. We continued to produce and release original content throughout this period, but the shift in focus was enlightening. </p>

<p>In 2011, Freedom Fever was relocated to Portland, Oregon and began focusing strictly on working with brands and filmmakers. With a simplified structure, Freedom Fever was able to begin hosting a number of experimental music projects. </p>
